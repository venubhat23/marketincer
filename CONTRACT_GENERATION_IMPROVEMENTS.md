# Contract Generation Improvements

## Changes Made

I've made several improvements to the contract generation system to address the following requirements:

1. **Automatic Date Replacement**: Replace `[Date]` placeholders with today's date
2. **Improved Party Name Extraction**: Better extraction of party names like "adidas" and "ram" from descriptions
3. **Remove Footer Text**: Remove the generated contract footer text

## Modified Files

### 1. `app/services/ai_contract_generation_service.rb`

#### Changes Made:

1. **Enhanced AI Prompt** - Updated `build_contract_prompt` method:
   - Added current date to prompt instructions
   - Added specific instructions to extract party names from description
   - Added instruction to remove footer text
   - The prompt now includes today's date and instructs the AI to use actual party names

2. **Improved Entity Extraction** - Updated `extract_entities` method:
   - Better pattern matching for party names
   - Handles both proper nouns and lowercase names
   - Filters out common words that aren't party names
   - More flexible name detection

3. **Template Updates** - Updated contract generation methods:
   - `generate_collaboration_contract`: Now uses current date instead of `[Date]` placeholder
   - `generate_basic_contract`: Now uses current date instead of `[Date]` placeholder
   - Removed footer text from templates

4. **Post-Processing** - Added `post_process_contract` method:
   - Removes footer text that mentions contract generation
   - Applied to both OpenAI and template-based generation
   - Uses regex patterns to clean up unwanted text

5. **Template Generation** - Updated `generate_with_template` method:
   - Now applies post-processing to remove footer text
   - Consistent handling across all generation methods

## Example Usage

For a request like:
```json
{
  "name": "DADSADSA",
  "description": "generate collaboration agreement between adidas and ram for 1000dollar for 1 week for 7 videos content post",
  "use_template": false
}
```

The system will now:
- Automatically replace `[Date]` with today's date (e.g., "July 13, 2025")
- Extract "adidas" and "ram" as party names from the description
- Use these names in the contract instead of generic placeholders
- Remove the footer text about contract generation

## Technical Details

### Date Handling
- Uses `Date.current.strftime("%B %d, %Y")` to format dates
- Applied consistently across all generation methods

### Party Name Extraction
- Improved regex patterns to catch various name formats
- Handles both capitalized and lowercase brand names
- Filters out common contract-related words

### Footer Removal
- Multiple regex patterns to catch different footer formats
- Applied to both AI-generated and template-based contracts
- Ensures clean contract output

## Testing

The changes have been implemented and are ready for testing. When the server is running, the same API endpoint will now produce contracts with:
- Today's date automatically filled in
- Proper party names extracted from descriptions
- Clean output without generation footers

The modifications maintain backward compatibility while improving the user experience significantly.
